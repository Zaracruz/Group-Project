            <p>HTMl is the standard markup language for Web Pages.
            HTML stand for Hyper Text Markup Language. It descirbes
            the strcuture of a webpage, it consists of a series of 
            elements, these elements tell the browser how to display
            the content.</p>

       <h4>Html is used to create webpages but does experience limitations<br>

        be used to add text elements and strutcture them within a page. For more<br>
        complex features, html can be combined with cascading style sheets(CSS) and javascript(JS).<br>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <section>
            <p>CSS is an acroynym for Cascading Style Sheets. Css is a 
                computer lanuage for laying out and styling web pages. It 
                is usually a textfile srtuctured using a markup language, the
                most commonly used markup is HTML. CSS can control the style
                of multiple web pages at once, or you can create seperate style
                sheets for different pages. </p>
            </section>
            <br>

        <h2>Types of CSS:</h2>
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr>
              <td>External</td>
              <td>Internal</td>
              <td>Inline</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>A file that HTML files will link to</td>
              <td>Specified at the beginning of an HTML document</td>
              <td>Written for a specific element in the HTML document.</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br>

        
        <h2>The Big Three</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Specificty</li>
            <li>Cascade</li>
        </ol> 
        <br>
        <br>

       <a>Inheritance</a>
       <br>
       <h4>Come CSS property values set on parent elements are inherited by<br> 
        their child elements, and some aren't. For example, if you set a<br>
        color and font-family on an element, every element inside it will <br>
        also be styled with that color and font, unless you've applied <br>
        different color and font values directly to them.
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This very page uses Inheritance css. As you can tell it isn't very
           flattering sometimes and can be difficult to keep track of.
        </p>
     </h4>

     <br>
     <br>
        <a>Specificty</a>
        <br>
       <h4>Specificity is the algorithm that the browser uses to decide<br>
         which property value is applied to an element. If multiple style blocks<br>
         have different selectors that configure the same property with different<br>
         values and target the same element, specificity decides the property value<br>
         that gets applied to the element. Specificity is basically a measure of how specific<br>
         a selector's selection will be:<br>

        <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
        <li>An element selector is less specific; it will select all elements of that type that appear on a page, so it has less weight. Pseudo-element selectors have the same specificity as regular element selectors.</li>
        <li> A class selector is more specific; it will select only the elements on a page that have a specific class attribute value, so it has more weight. Attribute selectors and pseudo-classes have the same weight as a class.</li>
    </ul>  
        </h4>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <a>Cascade</a>
        <br>
        <h4>Stylesheets cascade â€” at a very simple level, this means that the origin,<br>
             the cascade layer, and the order of CSS rules matter. When two rules from <br>
             the same cascade layer apply and both have equal specificity, the one that is <br>
             defined last in the stylesheet is the one that will be used.</h4>

        <h2>JavaScript (JS):</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript is the most popular programming language.</li>
            <li>It is a programming language used in Web Page design.</li>
            <li>It is easier than most to leanrn.</li>
            <li>It can be used to change HTML content.</li>
          </ul> 
             
          <br>
          <h2>JS Functions:</h2>

          <h4>A javascript function is a line of code that can be called to execute, for example<br>
            "On Click!" button below is a line of javascript code that is being carried out<br>

        <h2>Information on Javascript</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Client-Side Language: JavaScript runs on the client-side, meaning it executes<br>
              on the user's web browser rather than on a web server. This enables dynamic updates<br>
               without requiring the entire page to reload.</li>
               <br>
            <li>Syntax: JavaScript syntax is similar to other programming languages like Java and C.<br>
                 It's a versatile language supporting both object-oriented and functional programming<br>
                  paradigms.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Events: JavaScript allows you to define actions that occur in response to user interactions,<br>
                 such as clicks, mouse movements, keypresses, etc. These are called events, and you can attach<br>
                  event handlers to HTML elements to execute JavaScript code when the events occur.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Libraries and Frameworks: There are many JavaScript libraries and frameworks available to simplify<br>
                 and expedite web development tasks. Examples include jQuery, React.js, Angular.js, and Vue.js.</li>
